# Architecture

## The contract (both directions)

    participant Admin

    participant Agent as Example Agent

    Note over Admin,Agent: Registration — "A knows B is really B"
    Admin->>Gateway: register agent (https endpoint)
    Gateway->>Agent: GET /.well-known/agent-card.json
    Agent-->>Gateway: signed AgentCard (signatures[])
    Gateway->>Agent: GET card.jku (/.well-known/jwks.json)
    Agent-->>Gateway: card-signing public JWKS
    Gateway->>Gateway: verify card JWS + PIN kid/jku (TOFU)

    Note over Admin,Agent: Each call — "B knows A is really A"
    Gateway->>Agent: POST /a2a (Authorization: Bearer <gateway JWT>)
    Agent->>Gateway: GET /.well-known/jwks.json (gateway public JWKS)
    Gateway-->>Agent: gateway public JWKS
    Agent->>Agent: verify JWT (sig + iss + aud + exp)
    Agent->>Agent: run Workers-AI tool loop (soul + caller context)
    Agent-->>Gateway: A2A reply (LLM)
```

This agent therefore does three things:

1. **Serves a signed AgentCard** at `/.well-known/agent-card.json`. The card is
   signed with a detached-payload EdDSA flattened JWS over its **canonical JSON**
   (see [`src/auth/canonical.ts`](src/auth/canonical.ts)). The gateway verifies this and
   pins the signing key's `kid` + `jku` on first registration (Trust-On-First-Use).
2. **Publishes its card-signing public JWKS** at `/.well-known/jwks.json` (the
   card's `jku`), so the gateway can resolve the signing key.
3. **Verifies the gateway identity JWT** on every JSON-RPC call, resolving the
   gateway's public JWKS from the token's own `jku` header (RFC 7515 §4.1.2)
   and enforcing `iss`, `aud`, and `exp` against `GATEWAY_ORIGINS`.
   The verified caller identity is read from the namespaced
   `https://looping.ai/identity` claim and passed to the agent runtime.

> No secret is shared in either direction. The gateway proves it is the gateway
> with a signed JWT; this agent proves it is itself with a signed card. Each side
> only needs the other's **public** JWKS.

## Agent runtime (the LLM tool loop)

Once the JWT is verified, [`src/index.ts`](src/index.ts) hands the request to
[`LlmExecutor`](src/agent/executor.ts), which runs a **stateless** Workers-AI
tool loop for the turn:

- **Model pair** ([`src/agent/model.ts`](src/agent/model.ts)): a primary + fallback
  Workers-AI model (via [`workers-ai-provider`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/workers-ai-provider)
  routed through an AI Gateway). Model ids and the gateway slug are constants in
  [`src/agent/config.ts`](src/agent/config.ts).
- **Turn loop** ([`src/agent/loop.ts`](src/agent/loop.ts)): a bounded multi-step
  `generateText` loop (`stepCountIs(MAX_STEPS)`). If the primary model throws it
  retries once on the fallback; a transient (capacity/timeout) failure returns a
  friendly "try again" message. Always publishes exactly one agent message and
  calls `finished()`.
- **Soul + caller context** ([`src/agent/prompt.ts`](src/agent/prompt.ts)): a frozen
  identity/operating-rules prompt, suffixed per request with the verified caller
  from the JWT. The prompt is aware of the gateway's `<turn>` provenance wrapper
  (parsed, never authored — see [`src/agent/messages.ts`](src/agent/messages.ts)).
- **Tools** ([`src/agent/tools.ts`](src/agent/tools.ts)): placeholder `whoami` /
  `echo` tools that prove tool-calling end to end. `whoami` closes over the
  verified identity so it can't be spoofed from model input. Real domain tools
  (with per-call authorization) come in a later phase.

Nothing is persisted yet — each turn is independent. Memory, episodic recall, and
real domain tools are subsequent phases (see [`PLAN.md`](PLAN.md)).

## Canonical JSON (must match the gateway)

The card signature is computed over a deterministic serialization:

- object keys sorted recursively (ascending),
- `JSON.stringify` with no insignificant whitespace,
- the `signatures` field excluded,
- payload bytes = UTF-8, base64url (no padding) for the JWS.

[`src/auth/canonical.ts`](src/auth/canonical.ts) is a byte-for-byte copy of the gateway's
[`src/a2a/card-verify.ts`](https://github.com/Looping-AI/looping-gateway/blob/main/src/a2a/card-verify.ts) canonicalizer. **If you change one, change both.**
