# Looping AI Remote A2A Agent Template

A complete, deployable **reference custom agent** for
[looping-gateway](https://github.com/Looping-AI/looping-gateway). It shows
exactly what a third party must implement to be safely registered and routed to
by the gateway — using **zero shared secrets**. All trust flows through
asymmetric Ed25519 signatures over public JWKS.

## Getting Started

### 1. Install dependencies

```sh
npm install
```

### 2. Generate the local A2A signing key

```sh
cp .dev.vars.example .dev.vars
npm run keygen example-1
```

Copy the printed private JWK into `.dev.vars` as `A2A_SIGNING_KEY`.

### 3. Configure the gateway origin

In `.dev.vars`, point `GATEWAY_ORIGINS` at your deployed gateway:

```sh
GATEWAY_ORIGINS=["https://<your-gateway>"]
```

This must match the gateway's own `GATEWAY_ORIGIN`. Add multiple entries for multi-worker setups or domain transitions.

### 4. Run locally

```sh
npm run dev
```

The gateway is deployed to production, so it needs a publicly reachable URL to call back into your local machine. You need a tunnel.

**Option A — Built-in tunnel (quickest)**

Once the dev server is running, press **`t`** in the terminal. Wrangler starts a temporary `trycloudflare.com` URL and prints it:

```
⬣ Sharing via Cloudflare Tunnel: https://video-spots-novels-supplemental.trycloudflare.com/
```

Use that URL when registering the agent on the gateway (step 6). The limitation is that the URL is random and changes every tunnel session — you'll need to re-register the agent each time.

**Option B — Named tunnel with a fixed URL (long-term development)**

Requires a domain managed by Cloudflare (free tier works). One-time setup:

```sh
npx wrangler tunnel create remote-agent-dev
npx wrangler tunnel route dns remote-agent-dev <your-subdomain.yourdomain.com>
```

Then start your dev server with the tunnel in one command:

```sh
npx wrangler dev --tunnel --tunnel-name remote-agent-dev
```

Register the agent once at `https://<your-subdomain.yourdomain.com>` and the URL stays valid across restarts.

### 5. Deploy to production

Upload the signing key and gateway origins as Wrangler secrets, then deploy:

```sh
npm run keygen agent-1                 # generate new key for production
wrangler secret put A2A_SIGNING_KEY    # paste the new private JWK
wrangler secret put GATEWAY_ORIGINS    # paste, e.g. ["https://<your-gateway>"]
npx wrangler deploy
```

You can observe it (stats and logs) on your cloudflare dashboard.

## Register it on the gateway

In a workspace admin channel, ask the admin agent to register this agent with
its **HTTPS** endpoint (the deployed worker origin). Registration fails unless:

- the endpoint is HTTPS and passes the gateway's SSRF policy,
- the AgentCard is reachable and **validly signed**,
- the signing key resolves from the card's `jku`.

Attach it to channels, then mention it with its `::name` reference.
